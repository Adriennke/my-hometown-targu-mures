        <h2>
            A bit of history...
        </h2>

        <p>
            Named literally for a 'market' on the Mures River and known as the city of roses, Targu Mures
            (Marosvásárhely in
            Hun­garian ~ Neumarkt am Mieresch in German) enjoys the best of both Romanian and Hungarian cultures.
            Numerous
            vestiges
            attest the presence of Neolithic cultures and those of the Bronze and Metal Ages in this area.
            Archaeological
            diggings
            have brought to light Roman relics in the surrounding towns.
        </p>
        <p>
            The town was first documented as 'Novum Forum Sicolorum' (The New Market of the Seklars) in 1322. Beginning
            with
            the
            16th century, Targu Mures excels as an important cultural and education centre. The first school appears in
            1492. In
            1786, the first printing shop is established and in 1802 count Teleki Samuel, chancellor of Transylvania,
            lays
            the
            foundations of the documentary library that bears his name to this day. The city received a major boost to
            its
            social
            and economic life in 1754 when it became the seat of the supreme court of justice of the Principality of
            Transylvania.

            What you do really need to see
        </h2><br>
        <h3>The Culture Palace</h3>
        <p>
            The Culture Palace was built between 1820 and 1822 at the initiative of count Teleki Sámue.
            The building was initially decorated in the late Baroque style and had only two stories.
            The façade was modified in early 1900s, the only remaining Baroque elements are the reinforced vaults with
            double arcs.
            The ground floor was used for retail activities while the first floor was used as living quarters.
            On the second floor there was a large meeting hall, a restaurant and a café.
            At the beginning of the 20th century the palace served as a venue for numerous shows and events. In 1923
            Apollo
            Palace
            was sold to a new owner who decided to transform the balroom into apartments (1925 - 1927).
            The façade was also remodeled at that time in an eclectic style specific to the early 20th century.
            Today Apollo Palace is home to the local Art School.
        </p>
        <h3>The Palffy House</h3>
        <p>
            The first elements of Baroque architecture appeared, in Targu Mures, in the second half of the 17th century.
            The Pálffy House, built around 1640, reflects an evolutionary stage that surpasses typical Renaissance
            architectural
            elements such as those of the oldest buildings of Targu Mures, the Köpeczi and Nagy Szabó houses.
            The edifice was built by judge Tolnai János and sold to the Pálffy family in 1885, hence the name by which
            the
            building
            is known today.
            The building was renovated in 2006 and today it hosts the newly established Music School of the University
            of
            Theatrical
            Arts of Targu Mures.
        </p>
        <h3>The Teleki Library</h3>
        <p>
            The Teleki Library, founded at the end of the 18th century by Sámuel Teleki, chancellor of Transylvania,
            contains a
            large collection of first editions and important manuscripts documenting Transylvanian history, as well as
            mathematical
            and scientific works. Count Sámuel Teleki, closely connected to the Mures area through his origins and the
            fact
            that he
            spent part of his life at his personal residence in Dumbravioara (a village only a few kilometers outside of
            Targu
            Mures), had established here the first city library by making his 40,000 books – some of which were unique
            editions
            published by famous European printing houses – available to the public.
            More important collections were added in time, amounting to over 250,000 tomes today.
        </p>
        <h3>The Medieval Fortress</h3>
        <p>
            In 1492 Prince Stefan Bathory ordered for a castle-fortress to be erected around the Franciscan monastery
            and
            church. A
            few of the original elements have been preserved, among them wall fragments on the Southern and Western
            sides,
            the tower
            on the Southern wing, attached to the furriers' bastion, and ruins of the South-Western tower, included
            nowadays
            in the
            tanners' bastion. The structure of these towers and the fact that they are square-shaped are indicative of a
            medieval
            type military architecture.
