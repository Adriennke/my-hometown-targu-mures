                        Named literally for a 'market' on the Mures River and known as the city of roses, Targu Mures
                        (Marosvásárhely in Hun­garian ~ Neumarkt am Mieresch in German) enjoys the best of both Romanian and Hungarian cultures. Numerous vestiges attest the presence of Neolithic cultures and those of the Bronze and Metal Ages in this area. Archaeological diggings have brought to light Roman relics in the surrounding towns.

                        The town was first documented as 'Novum Forum Sicolorum' (The New Market of the Seklars) in 1322. Beginning with the 16th century, Targu Mures excels as an important cultural and education centre. The first school appears in 1492. In 1786, the first printing shop is established and in 1802 count Teleki Samuel, chancellor of Transylvania, lays the foundations of the documentary library that bears his name to this day. The city received a major boost to its social and economic life in 1754 when it became the seat of the supreme court of justice of the Principality of Transylvania.

                        <em>The Culture Palace</em> was built between 1820 and 1822 at the initiative of count Teleki Sámue.
                        The building was initially decorated in the late Baroque style and had only two stories. The façade was modified in early 1900s, the only remaining Baroque elements are the reinforced vaults with double arcs. The ground floor was used for retail activities while the first floor was used as living quarters. On the second floor there was a large meeting hall, a restaurant and a café. At the beginning of the 20th century the palace served as a venue for numerous shows and events. In 1923 Apollo Palace was sold to a new owner who decided to transform the balroom into apartments (1925 - 1927). The façade was also remodeled at that time in an eclectic style specific to the early 20th century. Today Apollo Palace is home to the local Art School.

                        The first elements of Baroque architecture appeared, in Targu Mures, in the second half of the 17th century. <em>The Pálffy House</em>, built around 1640, reflects an evolutionary stage that surpasses typical Renaissance architectural elements such as those of the oldest buildings of Targu Mures, the Köpeczi and Nagy Szabó houses. The edifice was built by judge Tolnai János and sold to the Pálffy family in 1885, hence the name by which the building is known today. The building was renovated in 2006 and today it hosts the newly established Music School of the University of Theatrical Arts of Targu Mures.

                        <em>Teleki Library</em>, founded at the end of the 18th century by Sámuel Teleki, chancellor of Transylvania, contains a large collection of first editions and important manuscripts documenting Transylvanian history, as well as  mathematical and scientific works. Count Sámuel Teleki, closely connected to the Mures area through his origins and the fact that he spent part of his life at his personal residence in Dumbravioara (a village only a few kilometers outside of Targu Mures), had established here the first city library by making his 40,000 books – some of which were unique editions published by famous European printing houses – available to the public. More important collections were added in time, amounting to over 250,000 tomes today.

                        In 1492 Prince Stefan Bathory ordered for a castle-fortress to be erected around the Franciscan monastery and church. A few of the original elements have been preserved, among them wall fragments on the Southern and Western sides, the tower on the Southern wing, attached to the furriers' bastion and ruins of the South-Western tower, included nowadays in the tanners' bastion. The structure of these towers and the fact that they are square-shaped are indicative of a medieval type military architecture.
